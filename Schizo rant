teeny little I guess "journal" or "diary" so I can write my thoughts in a place specifically for the code other than a private discord chat where I spam memes for safekeeping and crap
I have no clue WHY this is requiring the security hub mod, and I'll probably never find out why
Im not far but I just dont want to remake everything
it would just be a thorn in my side
Im not a good writer, I barely write in the first place
I barely read either, cant say I've even read more than one book in the last 6 months
but I guess everybody starts somewhere
