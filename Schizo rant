teeny little I guess "journal" or "diary" so I can write my thoughts in a place specifically for the code other than a private discord chat where I spam memes for safekeeping and crap
I have no clue WHY this is requiring the security hub mod, and I'll probably never find out why
Im not far but I just dont want to remake everything
it would just be a thorn in my side
Im not a good writer, I barely write in the first place
I barely read either, cant say I've even read more than one book in the last 6 months
but I guess everybody starts somewhere
imma go sleep and figure this out in the morning

ok I cant sleep
I'll continue to work on it I guess with the mod enabled

ok so i got a little sidetracked with something
a lot of the nebraska nations actually have a decent bit of lore
some of it makes questionable sense
like the redoubt's elite leader, Bahya
wouldnt you think that the order would do more to try to stop the people from leaving
plus shouldnt it give a debuff to the order or something
i dunno
anyway
NATIONS WITH UNIQUE CONTENT INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
The Order, with a whopping 3 unique leaders that I doubt anybody has seen, plus a unique general
mah boy Site Y, with Alabaster and Alabaster alone, but we're going to change that :)
Redoubt with an absurd amount of unique characters for an undeveloped region, still finding them all in game. To my knowledge, a total of 7. 3 generals, 3 people leaders, 1 elite leader, but im still looking through. EDIT - there is ONE unique advisor that is not just a country leader or general, so the total is 8\
EDIT 2 DOWN HERE 'CAUSE IT GOT ANNOYINGLY FAR - holy shit theres actually a LOT of content for the redoubt its actually kinda crazy how much they gave to them and pretty much them alone, like I get that the place is undeveloped but still. Each leader gets unique decisions post election, each following a main goal. Annabella being more of the peacekeeper, making a giant faction within nebraska, Leo being the imperalist, getting wargoals on most of the plaguelands, and ethan also being a conqueror, thought they'd make him a sort of "festung" path considering the backstory they made, guess he's different enough, getting outposts rather than robot bonuses. come to think of it, kinda dookie. Oddly enough, the elite broad, too lazy to remember her name, doesnt have a decision tree like the others.
Flawed Parish, 4 unique leaders, LUNA acting as both a general and an advisor, others being advisors aswell. Not sure about unique desisions but I doubt it
EDIT 3 - 2 unique formables, The Flawed Crusade for LUNA, and The Synthesium Fields for E-C

alright im tired, in the event I stay up I'll continue
wont make a new entry, I'll just continue off to make things easier

so there was a bug with the mod
it would not run if the other mod wasnt enabled at the same time
i probably stated that before but I dont care at this point
ITS BECAUSE OF THE FOLDER
