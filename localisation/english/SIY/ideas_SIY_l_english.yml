 SIY_PA_religion_desc:0 "During the war in Alaska, most if not all factories producing motor vehicles and their parts in Detriot were converted to the production of power armor. As a result, the culture switched from a love of cars to a love of PA. 200 years later, the residents of Detroit still have their obsession towards the suits. \n \n §CBack home, every man, woman, and child has at least one suit of power armor. While we can't quite provide the same for our population,§!§Y at least not until we regain contact with Power City,§! §Cwe can at least try to keep traditions alive.§!"
