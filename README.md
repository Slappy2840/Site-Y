# Site-Y Expansion for Old World Blues, circa 6/23

Yeah hi,
whoever decided to come here hi :)
My names Slappy!!1111!!!!!
how are youu :)
im doin' shitty.
you can look around here I dont really mind,
not all too interesting but you might like it.
if you play owb consider it a trailer for the submod :)
discord wouldnt let me post my code anymore so I needed a place to dump it.
had a headache so I needed something with a back base,
so I chose github.
I've never used github before but I cant imagine its too hard.

I hate paradox modding.
